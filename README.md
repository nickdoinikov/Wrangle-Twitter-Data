### Project Title
***Wrangle and Analyze Twitter data***

### Description
This project in the part of the ***"Data Analyst Nanodegree"*** by Udacity. In this Project, I wrangled and analyzed multiple datasets of Twitter user `@dog_rates`, also known as `WeRateDogs`.
The three main goals of this project were:
1. **Gather** the data from (at least) 3 different sources:
  * download one dataset manually;
  * download one dataset programmatically having a ready-to-use URL at hand;
  * get one dataset by using `Tweepy` - Twitter's API for developers.
2. **Assess** the datasets using visual and programmatic assessments and create a comprehensive list of issues (quality and tidiness)
3. **Clean** the data:
  * use `pandas` and `numpy` functions to clean the data, correct it, slice it etc.  
  * merge some (or all) data frames - if needed;
4. Provide some **Insights and visualizations** using the obtained clean data

### Files used
I used the following files to accomplish the project:
* **README.md** ;
* **twitter-archive-enhanced.csv** - database that I downloaded manually using a hyperlink on the course's page;
* **image-predictions.tsv** - database that I had to download programmatically using `Requests` library;
* **tweet-json.txt** - the text file that is obtained after interacting with `Tweepy`;
* **wrangle_act.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook with all the detailed steps in Data Wrangling in this Project;
* **wrangle_report.pdf** - the file that briefly describes my wrangling efforts;
* **act_report.html** - the file that communicates the insights and displays the visualizations produced from the wrangled data;

### Credits
During the preparation and the submission of the project, **no external source** was used during the submission.
